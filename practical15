Program: 15 Consider a situation where a user needs to analyze a set of numbers they input into 
a system. Imagine a data entry operator who inputs 25 different numbers via the 
keyboard. The goal is to develop a C program that processes these numbers to 
determine specific characteristics: how many of the numbers are positive, how 
many are negative, how many are even, and how many are odd. 
Code: // Practical 15: Create Simple Sorting System For Entered Numbers. 
 
#include <stdio.h> 
 
 
int main() { 
    int numbers[25];// Here Numbers Are Fixed. 
    int positive= 0, negative= 0, even= 0, odd= 0; 
 
    printf("Enter 25 Numbers:\n");// Taking 25 Numbers As A Input From User. 
    for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) { 
        scanf("%d", &numbers[i]); 
    } 
 
    // Here Loop Stands For Sorting Numbers. 
    for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) { 
        if (numbers[i] > 0) { 
            positive++; 
        } else if (numbers[i] < 0) { 
            negative++; 
        } 
        if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) { 
          even++; 
        } else { 
            odd++; 
        } 
    } 
 
//Print All The Results. 
    printf("Your Results:\n"); 
    printf("Total Positive numbers: %d\n", positive); 
    printf("Total Negative numbers: %d\n", negative); 
    printf("Total Even numbers: %d\n", even); 
    printf("Total Odd numbers: %d\n", odd);
     
 
 
printf("\n\n\n24ce032_TARANG")
}
